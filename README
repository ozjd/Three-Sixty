After finding a 360 degree panorama on Wikipedia, I wanted to view it properly.
When I noticed that a Java plugin was required for something so simple, I set out to do it myself.

There are few things left to do:
- Show errors if browser doesn't support stylesheets/javascript, etc
- Show a loading screen (many photo's take a while to download)
- (Possibly) add buttons to allow moving the view without a keyboard.

That's all I can think of...
